when we log into github, if we have project we see otherwise we see empty 
to add project first we click on username then he navigate or redirect us into home
then we click plus sign and we touch new repository 
and we write the name of repository
most of command are come from git we learned and we add some off git command to store project in github 
git remote add origin write path of folder
git push -u origin master
